This is your deal.\"I strongly disagree.  You can find MUCH BETTER distortions for $100 or less, even a few near or under the $40 mark the DS-1 is currently priced at.I've played guitar for over 10 years.  Like many people one of my first pedal purchases was the DS-1.  Afterall, everyone talks about them, they're available at any given music store in the nation, you hear about all these famous musicians using them, plus a DS-1 is actually pretty cheap!  So I snapped one up just like everyone else.  Come to find out that just because something is POPULAR, that doesn't always mean its GOOD (see: Nickelback, the Transformers movie franchise, the Kardashian family, etc...).So I plugged it in and didn't really care for it.  The distortion was harsh, thin, artificial sounding and always noisy.  I tried it on both my amps (My practic amp: a solid state Fender Frontman 25R, and my big amp, the B-52 AT100, which is a 100w tube halfstack) It was was not very diverse, and the basic sound was not very likeable to me.  I've read the Japanese made DS-1's are better in sound than the newer, made in Taiwan models but, either way, the DS-1 is just not a great pedal in my mind.But, like many newer players, I didn't know any better at the time.  Fast forward a few years and I've bought and sold literally dozens of pedals.  There is a whole world of great tones to be found out there if you keep your eyes open.So here are some pedals I currently own that I like much better than the DS-1.  All of them are great general purpose distortions, easy enough to find new and used in most guitar shops, and can, at the time of this writing, be bought brand new for $75 or less here on good ol' Amazon.com, and are rugged enough to last for years:Boss DS-2 Turbo Distortion:  Lest I catch any flames from people thinking I'm a Boss hater (I'm certainly not, I loved the TU-3, the ODB-3, the MD-2, and the XT-2, among others) I'll start with the DS-1's big brother.  This pedal has a much nicer tone to it, not to mention 2 distinct distortion modes.  The I setting is pretty much a higher quality DS-1, the II setting is a brighter, richer tone.  As the DS-1 completely overshadows the DS-2 in popularity, you can find DS-2's all over ebay for very cheap prices.  A very worthy pedal, unfortunately overlooked by many.Pro Co RAT2:  Great dirty distortion pedal.  Probably my personal favorite.  You've heard this box used on literally hundreds if not thousands of songs in the last 30 years, its used by just a ridiculous amount of guitarists.  Its a rich, full distortion that at higher gains gets slightly fuzzy.  I've never heard a bad tone out of mine. Its great for getting a \"big amp\" kind of sound out of a small practice amp.  Its also great for pushing a big amp with too much headroom into the overdriven sweet spot without having to crank the amp volume.  A truly excellent pedal.EHX Little Big Muff:  The Big Muff is another pedal you've heard on hundreds of songs.  Its kind of a fuzz, kind of a distortion, but definitely owns its own sonic territory.  Very big, saturated and warm.  Used heavily in the 70's for classic rock tones, also in the 90's and beyond for tons of grunge and garage.  Used by everyone from Carlos Santana and David Gilmour to the Smashing Pumpkins, Dinosaur Jr. and Jack White.  I personally reccomend the Little Big Muff, not only is it a touch creamier in tone than the recent NYC reissue, its smaller, uses a regular 9v adapter and its CHEAPER!  A great pedal.MXR Distortion +:  The Distortion + is a great first distortion, and can usually be found pretty cheap.  Whats nice about the Distortion + is that it sounds great on anything, and the lack of a tone knob helps keep it somewhat transparent, i.e. you can more easily hear the natural tone of your guitar and amp, it doesn't cover over your equipments sound.  Used by quite a few famous folks, including the Greatful Deads Jerry Garcia, Randy Rhoads (Ozzy's famous guitarist) and Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols.Danelectro CM-1 Cool Cat Metal:  Make sure you get the Cool Cat Metal, NOT the Metal II.  That's a fine pedal as well, but its definitely more of a traditional metal pedal.  The Cool Cat Metal, or CM-1, is actually a very very different pedal from most metal pedals.  Basically, its a pre-amp that sits on the floor.  It has a fully adjustable EQ with tons of volume and gain through the roof.  So you can do anything from a clean boost (with the gain at minimum there is virtually NO coloration to your tone) to high gain metal stuff, with plenty of great overdrive and rock tones in between.  It works well with any amp I've tried it on, and you can find tons of great sounds.  Its an unbelievably versatile pedal, and its even true bypass.  The best part is, Danelectro seems to have made way too many of them, so you can easily find one used or even new for under $30.  A true hidden gem that's actually CHEAPER than a DS-1.Joyo JF-03 Crunch Distortion:  This little guy surprised me.  Its supposedly a clone of the MI Audio Crunch Box, and, if so, that must be one awesome pedal too.  Its essentially a Marshall stack in a box, and boy does it ever succeed at that.  Great crunch, tons of volume and gain, it really can make your practice amp sound like a big ragin' stack!  It even sounded good going into my modeling amp (very few pedals work well with my modeling amp, and this one even sounded better than the Marshall simualtion built in), and you can get a brand new one for $40 shipped, fantastic!Speaking of Joyo, I've had a few of their pedals as well as one or two from MOEN, another Chinese pedal maker, and I'm honestly floored by how nice they sound given their shockingly low price tag (especially theMOEN MO-FM Fuzz Moowhich honestly out Big Muffs every Big Muff I've ever played through).  So JOYO and MOEN, they both make a variety of great sounding fuzz, od, and dirt pedals, check them out (and before anyone gets all up in arms about supporting a Chinese company, please keep in mind that NONE of the pedals listed in my review, DS-1 included, are made in America, let alone the western hemisphere).Hopefully these suggestions give you something to look for.  Also, if you can't actually try a pedal out at the store, YouTube is great place to hear demos of what different pedals can do.I should also mention that if you try and love the DS-1 and it suits your needs, than more power to you.  Tone is subjective, every pedal sounds different running through different guitars and amps, and just because I may share different opinions on something that you love, that's okay.  My main reason for posting this lengthy review is to give newer players some information.  You have PLENTY of options for distortion pedals, the DS-1 is NOT the only thing out there that's affordable.  Find something you truly love and buy that.  If its the DS-1, one of the pedals I've mentioned here, or anything else, the important part is that it sounds right to YOU.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Wish I knew then what I know now...", "unixReviewTime": 1309392000, "reviewTime": "06 30, 2011"}

Hawkins \"HumanJHawkins\"", "helpful": [7, 9], "reviewText": "I was very disappointed in both the quality and engineering of this product. A work-around for the main issue follows the review. The flaws that bother me in order of significance are:1) Quality: Very weak soft-metal screws. Using minimal force and a well aligned driver there was some damage to the screw-heads on all 4 that I worked with. 2 of them rounded out so much that I was afraid they would be hard to remove later, causing me to run to the hardware store for higher quality replacement screws.2) Engineering : The instructions recommend, and the screws (the ones that come with the straplocks) are designed for a #2 Phillips screwdriver. However, a standard #2 driver is too big to fit into the strap-buttons. So you are likely to have to choose between grinding down a screwdriver to fit, or using a #1 which will increase the impact of the first problem above since it is the wrong tool for the job.3) Engineering : The point of connection for the strap is 5/8th of an inch out from the guitar. The strap button has a radius about 3/16ths of an inch. Therefore any lateral stress (i.e. weight of the guitar) is magnified by more than 3x due to leverage pulling outward on the screw. A 9 pound guitar would be applying a constant 27 to 30 pounds of force on the screw and the wood around it (half that when the weight is distributed evenly on two strap buttons of course). Get a little too active on stage and the level of force could go way higher.Realistically, if the screws weren't total crap, this might have been a 3 or 4 star review. Once you deal with the fact that a normal screwdriver won't fit and get the things properly installed, it would probably work out for most people. So if you are stuck with a set, here's what I recommend:Go to a hardware store and buy #6 x 1\" oval-head stainless steel replacement screws. Note that these won't fit properly, but they are the closest match and can be modified. (They are 21 cents each at my local stores, and would have cost Dunlop maybe 10 cents more in bulk than what they paid for the crap screws that come with this.)Put the screw into an electric drill (pointy end in) so the screw head is rotating smoothly when you operate the drill. Run the drill while using a file or a belt sander to take a fraction of the diameter off the screw head. It doesn't need much. I used a belt sander and it took about 20 seconds each. While you are at it, file down a cheap #2 screwdriver so it will fit into the strap button.Install with the new screws as normal, and recommend that your friends try a different brand!", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Disappointing Quality and Engineering", "unixReviewTime": 1306886400, "reviewTime": "06 1, 2011"}

Mainly due to the low cost. They work okay, but are difficult to keep in tune. The guitars have to be re-tuned often when temperature, humidity, or playing more than ten minutes occurs. My biggest complaint is tarnish and corrosion. Add that to the winding separating over the fret bars exposing the inner solid string, then the strings go \"flat\" sounding. These are not quality strings at all, just cheap Chinese Made quality. They are okay for someone that doesn't play often, but if you play daily or as a performer, avoid these strings. Better strings are worth the extra cost. You actually save money by not having to replace them often as you do with these cheap strings. I've had this problem with all the D'Addario brand strings, both for electric or acoustic, 6 or 12 string guitars. The thinner gauge strings will break during tuning or playing. The tarnish and corrosion often ends up contaminating the fret bars and keeping the neck dirty all the time.

I had a cable with the standard Neutrik/Switchcraft-type ends fail on me, and this cable was supposed to be either strain free or simply designed for long life because of the strain of usage.It worked great for about 4-6 months, and then broke. It happened so quickly (the trad types seem to take longer) that I swore it must have been the output jack on my guitar. After confirming the guitar was okay, I tried a shorter cable, which worked fine.D'Addario does offer lifetime replacement, but it puts you in a bit of a bind - you need a backup cable while you are waiting for a replacement, and you have to pay return shipping of the defective cable out-of-pocket. You also have to get R.A. Taken altogether, this makes it a deal breaker. The extra costs essentially make this cable as expensive as something that has a track record of lasting for years. In my case, I bit the bullet and did what I should have done the first go-round and got a really nice DiMarzio cable.Again, this cable SOUNDS good while it works - capacitance with the longer cables can be an issue. The good news is that IMO high price is not a guarantee of ANY cable sounding good. The replacement DiMarzio is another example of one that was at the top of the list with cable comparisons. I don't get into the mojo or intangible aspects that will typically find someone paying much more for a cable, but I want durability and published capacitance that is within a certain range. This one meets half of those criteria, but it gets expensive because of the potential to fail sooner rather than later. Well, expensive relative to a cable with an initially higher price but longer lifespan.So the replacement that Planet Waves sent me is now the backup, and is still in the original packaging. I figure I'll use it only for short periods while replacing my main cable, so it should last a long time in that situation. If I have a few $ for the shipping and D'Addario is still honoring the lifetime warranty if/when the 2nd one breaks, I may get it replaced. More likely I will just chalk it up to a learning lesson and toss it. Even $4 shipping is a decent percentage of the cost of a more durable cable - IMO it should be set aside to fund its eventual replacement.If this cable would have last 1.5 to 2 years, I'd probably give it 5 stars given the price. And if D'Addario took away the warranty thing, it would probably re-shape the customer's perception on what something at this price should cost, because it's a wear item, plain and simple. IDK how much R&D; it's worth their trouble to put in something at this price point, but that's is what I would shoot for - a realistically acceptable period of trouble-free use w/no warranty as the trade-off. That would NOT make it a deal breaker.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "was good while it worked", "unixReviewTime": 1378166400, "reviewTime": "09 3, 2013"}

(Those units have their own tone problems but that's another review.)It does occur to me that any pedal with a buffer (NOT \"true bypass\" in other words) may fix this problem, which is more than likely related to impedance, like a tuner pedal, between the guitar and the volume pedal.  I will need to try that out, but it does not excuse Ernie Ball from their responsibility.

If I'd only played the Yamaha I'd probably think it was a pretty nice guitar, but having tried all of these side-by-side I can definitely say it's not at all amazing. The Bristol blows this thing out of the water, and not just because it's $50 cheaper, it plays and sounds better. The Johnson guitars both have a little higher action, not a lot of highs, and a cheaper fit and finish. The Jasmine is nice but I haven't spent enough time playing it to give a true review.The Yamaha FG700GS is definitely neat to look at, and has decent mids, but doesn't really have a great high to low end punch. Now, it it quite a bit wider at the bottom so it has some more body, but, the sound range overall wasn't great. The Bristol has great highs and plenty of deep lows in comparison. Also, the fretboard felt a wee bit thicker on the Yahama, though putting them next to the other guitars it looked about the same.Can't help but think that the reviews here are a bit \"hive mind\" where everybody buys into a hype.

(personally, I only thought 1 of them sounded realistic at all though)Cons- fizzy noise integrated with notes played (or chords)- generally kind of noisy in the pedal chain- While I have several Boss pedals, I think they always make the knobs too small and the font/print too small. I prefer pedals with larger and fewer knobs that can be tweaked with your toe if needed while playing.Details:The basic concept is good. I had an AC-2 (prior model) and sold it because it had a noise problem where there was a fizzy noise when you play a note. It wasn't in between the notes or when not playing, it was integrated with the sound of every note you played (or chord) and you could not filter it. It was also just noisy in the pedal chain. Adjusting your guitar volume down for higher gain pickups helps some. However, I sold that model because I didn't want the pedal in the chain with everything else and I wasn't happy with the sound. At the time, the AC-2's were selling for about $85 new. Boss since redesigned AND raised the price significantly on the AC-3.I bought the AC-3 hoping they had improved the issues of the AC-2 -- and they did, a little. But not enough to keep it. I returned it after a week because it still has the same basic issues, just not as pronounced. I think the AC-3 could work for gigging, but there are other choices that sound as good for $25 instead of $130 to $150 (with tax and/or shipping) so to me, the boss pedal is overpriced and not that great.I opted for a Behringer acoustic modeller instead. They make two -- a &#34;300&#34; and a &#34;400&#34;. The 400 has reverb on the pedal. I opted for the 300 and got it for $25. I expect the durability will be lower on the Behringer than the Boss as it has a plastic case. However, this is an effect I pull out just once in a while and since I can buy 4 or 5 or 6 Behringers for the price of a Boss....if it breaks...I'll just buy another.I also have a Boss GT-100 multi-effects unit. You can get the same or similar acoustic modelling sounds out of that, out of the Behringer or out of the Boss AC-3. The least cost effective of those choices is the AC-3 - and it has noise issues the other two don't have.I'm not saying its a bad pedal, I'm just saying it wasn't the best choice for me when considering the cost, the sounds, and my usage model. If they would fix the noise issues, I might have even kept it. I did opt to keep the Behringer for those times I'm using a discrete pedal board and want an acoustic model effect. This Boss pedal just didn't work that well for me.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Bought it - returned it. Still has noise issue similar to prior model AC-2.

The pedal on its face looks like a good piece of equipment and feels quite sturdy.  However you do have to use a 9 volt batter to make it operate.  This is totally unnecessary for a foot-switch.  The worst part is the leads on the battery connector (9 volt) were not properly soldered or had shorted out.  The only way I could get it to function was to let the 9volt battery dangle just right and connection would be made.  For the rather high asking price and the limited function that is needed (i.e. all that has to work are two switches and a battery) you would think that Boss would put out a better product.  I also found that the battery cover was extremely cheap and was difficult to close, leading me to believe that the durability of the cover was in question.

Its snake-head headstock with the tiny, not-great tuners looks out of place on a dreadnaught guitar.- The cedar top is very nice looking, and the rosewood fretboard/bridge on mine are very nice.- The laminate sides/back seem much thicker than competing guitars, and this makes the guitar heavier and, to me, less &#34;alive&#34;/resonant during playing.- The satin-finished cedar top is very easy to marr.- The cedar is warm at low to mid strumming force, but at a heavy strum, the top seems to bottom out and lose definition.- The treble sounds tinny to me and the bottom end seems muddy.- The frets are smaller than competitors but are OK.- The binding is a sharp 90 degree angle without any radius to it so it cuts into the chest and arms after playing - something I've not encountered before.- I can get the action very, very low before the frets rattle - nice!All in all, it is an OK instrument that stands out simply because it's made in Canada for Asian/Mexican prices - that said, just because it comes from Canada doesn't embody it with mystical vibes. In fact, for the price range, I can get a just-as-good Asian/Mexican guitar with a nicer laminate back/front, Sitka spruce solid top wood, better tuners, and a more attractive headstock - with a gloss finish for durability and that sounds just as good.I don't regret getting it, but I feel like I overpaid for what I received, and while the brand might have been a great deal at last decade's exchange rates, I have seen much better guitars in shops for the same price.

The plugs on this generic version are larger than the 1 Spot and the wires are kind of stiff plastic. The original 1 Spot plug has much smaller plugs, great for saving space on a pedal board, and the wires are soft and &#34;rubbery&#34;, again making it easier to work with on a pedal board, specially if you're working with a pedal board like Pedaltrain where you can intertwine wires in and out between bars.

In my email to them I included an image of the original packaging of the 1 Spot 8 Plug to make sure there would be no mistake, but to my amazement they sent me another compatible plug. I emailed them again for a refund, which they promptly did. I can say, that they did respond quickly and they refunded my money. I imagine that those who order this plug without ever having worked with an original 1 Spot plug, wouldn't know the difference because although it is a really cheap version it does have eight 9v connectors.

Nothing stopped the buzz.  If they are warmed up and you turn them off and then on again, the buzz starts up in more like 10 or 20 seconds.  So I sent them back.  I wasn't really impressed with the sound and I'm definitely not satisfied with the quality control, so I'm going to try some larger and more expensive monitors instead.

I have a Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus.The documentation that comes with this pedalboard specifically states that this power supply mounts under the board, and it even includes mounting brackets that fit this power supply. However, if you actually try to mount it to the underside of the board as suggested, you're in for an unpleasant surprise.First of all, regarding the two circular holes on the front of the board. The fitment to the power supply is there... sort of. There's no way to align them perfectly because the holes on the pedaltrain 2 are slightly too close together. I wasn't worried about this, since I doubt I'll ever chain them and only have access to 1 outlet.The second issue is, the allegedly self-tapping screws that come with the mounting kit strip as though they were made of butter. Once you've got them in (or attempted to do so), they're never coming out. You'll probably have to break them. It's a shame to have cut corners on something so inexpensive.The main issue I have with this board relating to my Voodoo Lab power supply is this. Once you get the power supply mounted properly on the underside of the board (it can only go one place), you begin to plug in your pedals and you discover that the cables supplied with the power supply don't fit the mounting location on this board. You can't plug them in because there's not enough clearance between the frame of the pedalboard and the sockets the cables plug in to.I really only bought this pedalboard because of the supposed perfect compatibility with the Voodoo Lab power supply I own, but given that it doesn't fit like it's supposed to, I wish I could return this board - except I can't, because it now has holes drilled in it.

If I try to record a line level signal from a sound board or stereo receiver and connect to the H4n's 1/4 inch jacks, it is almost impossible to not to have a distorted signal.  It appears that on both models the line in preamp is too sensitive and clips very easily and because it is clipping in the preamp, adjusting the gain doesn't correct it.  I contacted Zoom's tech support about the H2 and was told that I likely had a defective unit.  I returned the H2 and decided to give Zoom another chance and try the H4n after seeing many positive reviews.I really like the H4n's design, the menus and controls are nicely organized.  It feels more sturdy than the H2.  The recording quality using the built in mics is excellent.  Most other recorders in this price range don't have XLR inputs.  Since I plan to use it mostly for recording concerts by connecting to a line out or tape out on a sound board, if the line in jacks don't work properly and can't accept a normal line level signal without clipping, I can't use this for what I bought it for.

I've worked with pro sound equipment for over 25 years and have used many types of recorders and so far the Zoom products are the only ones where I have encountered this problem.

First, in the setup screen do NOT enable the FBV Express. Yes, I know this sounds dumb, but internet scouring shows there is a bug that this is a workaround for...2. Read the FBV Express users guide and calibrate the pedal.. there is no need to d/l the FBV software for this.Now.. In the POD setup screens you have the option to either have the ABCD buttons as ABCD, or to be FS5-FS8. This behavior is mimicked by the 4 switches on the FBV.So.. In ABCD mode you can:a) Select preset A, B, C or D from the group you are currently in.b) Insert a volume FX and use volume pedal...EXP2c) Insert another FX enabled by toe switch, and controlled by pedal as EXP1d) tap temp (by tapping the currently selected preset..ie the pedal that is lit)e) enable the tuner (press/hold the current selected preset pedal)f) you have some basic control of the looper, but CANNOT enable it.3/10/14 EDIT :Looper control is flawed. You can record and go to overdub, but you cannot record then play/stop the loop.. you can stop from overdub but not start the loop. seemingly an acknowledged and unfixed bugNice enough, but if you are like me, switching presets is way way less useful than switching FX blocks on & off. incidentally you can combine blocks such that one pedal (say) turns OD on, and delay & chorus both off, or turn one amp on and one off (channel switching).. YAY!! you cry, that sounds like me so its a NO to ABCD and mode FS5-FS8 it is for me!..SO yup in FS5-8 mode you can do that, you cana) enable/disable 4 sets of block(s) using the four pedalsb) use volume and expression options as above (ie like volume or wah, overdrive level, delay FB etc)c) basic control of looper BUT cannot enable itEDIT 3/19/14 looper control flawed as stated abovec) enable the tuner?...oh sod it. nope you can'td) tap tempo?.. nope not that either.So in summary, the Express is better than nothing, but certainly does not provide hands free operation of the desktop.. the shortboard is worth the extra, or if you are reading this before buying the pod.. get the HD500x instead.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Express MkII and POD HD Desktop.. don't bother", "unixReviewTime": 1394323200, "reviewTime": "03 9, 2014"}

The body is 2 inches wide (less than the 2.75 inches stated for this stand).  My uke does not fit well in the stand.  Why?  The twin forks at the base that hold the instrument are both too narrow, and the curve downward from the stand is not proper for this uke.  Thus, any uke that is concert size or greater.  So, most ukes don't fit well.  They fit, just not well.I did, and you will likely need this advice, remove the bottom fork, turn it upside down, and reinstall it (no tools required).  Now the \"curve\" of it is upward, and the uke better sits on it.  The fit is improved.  Not great but better.  One stand can't fit all instruments, but my full size guitar stands hold most all guitars.  This small stand does not hold most all ukes.Although its neat how it folds up, like the video here on Amazon reviews, it is very heavy for its size.  This is not a lightweight stand.  At all.

And got burned for it.All in all, not great, this tiny stand.  One stand fits NOT all.  Perhaps a violin or something would be better on this stand, but I think the general shape of it is less than ideal for most instruments.  You may think you can bend the lower forks, but it's hard to do, will require a vice, and if you see on the Amazon pictures, the lower fork just sits in two plastic grooves, so if you splay it out like it should be, you'll change the way it fits in the grooves, and thus it won;t work at all.

My friend's Oscar Schmidt 3/4 sized guitar was just that much smaller and it did not fit well. The edges did not \"catch\" completely  and it looks terrible.My classical guitar had a similarly sized soundhole but because of the much wider fretboard at the edge of the soundhole, it did not fit at all. You could try cutting the edges off the Oport at the fretboard.The main issue is the sound.Yes, it does make the sound fuller when you are strumming, slightly but enough to tell.However, it does so at the expense of the sustain and harmonic overtunes.Fingerpicking just does not sound as nice as before, even though the guitar is noticeably better on the bass notes.For me, that does not justify it.A simple bone saddle does way better than this and it cost less.Another thing I found out was what was Amazon does to stuff others return - they resell as brand new if it looks brand new.The packaging on mine came slightly torn and looked as if it had been opened.

Be advised that I did not use it in front of a microphone where perhaps the shape of this internal plastic cone might do something you like in directing the sound to a mike. As strictly an issue of natural acoustics, I found it deflected sound in a way that seemed to decrease my guitar's output and resonance. I have an Aria AD-80 which is a very well-made Chinese attempt at cloning a Martin D-42. It can not compete with the real Martin but for the money I paid it was a great buy and it is known as a \"sound canon\" for it's great natural volume. Adding the O-Port deadened the lows. It just didn't provide any plus at all anywhere else. It is however pretty inexpensive so if you're a nut for nuance and you want to try it for yourself it's not going to break your bank. But again, if you have one of the better makes of guitar where a real person \"voiced it\" in his or her manufacturing process, this plastic gizmo will likely subtract from that and not add anything. I'm an acoustic nut and I'd love to have a sound port in the side of my guitar to hear everything that goes on inside that box.

When I first got it I liked the sound, though it did sound a little cold and digital, and this is from someone wanting to record shoegaze/dreampop, which by it's nature is full of cold tones (reverb/chorus/delay) shimmering, a la cocteau twins, chapterhouse, lush, so at first I thought it was great. Then the fuse software was even cooler, all this customizing the sound, though it did sound noisy and needed the compressor to take some of the noise away.After all of that I finally realized I was trying to ignore the fizz/crackle/hair, it's called a few things. Go to the fender forums and look it up, or search it on yahoo/google.The thing happening with this amp I think is a few things. Fender guitars sound best through it, which is silly if you don't own a fender, and I don't and refuse to get a squire as that body is so played out, I wanted ANYTHING but a strat body, unless I have a grand to pay for an older one, I'm not going to get a rinky dink one, and I would only get one after I got like 5 other dream guitars first.so everyone has different problems with pickup quality and guitar quality. Also, playing into a modeling amp is like playing into a computer, that may be fine for some (younger folks), but to a lot of people I've read the complaints I was trying not to realize, as I didn't feel like having to pay for shipping to return it, BUT I DID!And I am so glad I did. I almost got a peavey vypyr, and I am glad I didn't. This amp, to be fair, is really close to being really cool, but that sound problem, which I read on fender's own forum/website, FENDER ACKNOWLEDGES IT EXISTS, BUT DOES NOTHING TO FIX IT IN FUTURE MODELS!! sorry, but that's some big company b.s.I've been reading of people saying it sounds cold and lifeless and all that and tube this and tube that, and I was like \"what music snobs\" and what have you.

So I returned the mustang 2 and ALMOST got a marshall mg 30 watt, cause I wanted an amp with a clean sound that didn't have that crackle sound, but THANKFULLY I caught myself before that return, as after that, it would have been final.The decision I did make I think will be great for me, as I'd rather start with a good real tone, then get the effects I need. I kept reading reviews of these teenagers that hadn't played for more than a year or two or so saying \"throw away your pedals, you won't need them\" and \"I was going to get pedals, but don't need to now\", that's kind of the danger of these amps, they end up making everyone sound the same! No matter what tweaking I was doing on the mustang, it sounded the same but in a different costume.I think this amp and modeling amps are best for beginning guitarists and I've seen some old timers getting an amp for home use after years, maybe that's for them, but I needed something to record with and practice and get the best, most real tone possible, so that means tube amp.I think if I played this at a GC I wouldn't of gotten it, and I just tried to make myself like it.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "this amp is oooookay , fizzle/crackle, and noise when you aren't playing", "unixReviewTime": 1327363200, "reviewTime": "01 24, 2012"}

This was my first Fender amp as well.The presets were neat and all, but when I played around with some of the \"standard\" models (just the amp model, no effects) just to see how it's clean sound was, the amp just hissed as if I had the volume cranked with a distortion pedal engaged at max. The master volume was at 2 and no effects were turned on... I've never heard a clean channel with so much noise behind it, even when there was no guitar plugged in... All I could hear while playing was the underlying hiss coming through the notes; very distracting and it drove me nuts! This isn't a ground loop issue (my other amps sound just fine at bedroom volumes and beyond), it's clearly a defect with this product. Dirty pre-sets with lots of gain and extra volume sound even worse, again, even when nothing is plugged in and at low master volume. You'd think I was running a few super high gain stomp boxes with a red hot single coil, but NOTHING was plugged in and all I get is staticy-hiss at LOW LEVELS. WTF?The next issue is the weird \"fizz\" sound, that was especially noticeable on the low e. After striking a string, instead of a clean note, there's a weird fizzy digital artifact like sound that \"surrounds\" the note, and fades as the string stops moving. It almost sounds like cymbals crashing on a poorly authored MP3 file at a low bit rate and frequency. Whole chords break down and decay in this fizzy envelope and really makes this thing unplayable.The weird thing is, neither one of these problems arose with head phones plugged in, or when this was connected to my computed via either USB or the line in... but I'm not going to be stuck playing a 100 watt amp through my PC or cans. I got the III instead of the II because of the power behind it and the touted 12\" Celestion speaker.Read the many reviews online or forum posts on many of the guitar/amp related websites (there's a 65 page forum post on the Fender support site that is quite interesting) and you'll find that these amps are having issues. Apparently, the Mustang I and II don't have these issues, and the firmware update did NOTHING to correct my amp. Is this a hardware issue, software issue, speaker issue? There is speculation that the LCD screen (which is not present on the I or II) may be causing problems, but no one seems to know for sure and Fender doesn't seem to care...Definitely try this before you buy it. You may get an amp that doesn't have these problems, you may not notice the sounds or you may not even care; let your ears tell you what sounds good.This amp has a lot of potential for great sounds, and it would have been nice to have faithful modeling of some great vintage amps, but in my opinion, technical issues have made this amp sound like complete garbage. I am disappointed that Fender hasn't yet correct what ever is wrong (some folks claim that Fender reps say that know what is wrong, but I'm not taking that as a fact...), but they have acknowledged that there is \"something\" wrong.Whatever... I took this back after a few days of playing with it, trying to eliminate the junk sounds without success( the built-in noise gate helps a little, but sucks tone) and I picked up a 100 watt Marshall instead. Guess what? The clean channel has ZERO hum or buzz, even when cranked. How about that? Even when I engage a dirt box on one of the dirty channels, there is minimal noise.I'll knock Fender for NOT correcting this issue regardless of what it is and what caused it, but they do have some other nice amps that I'd like to try. But before I buy another Fender amp, I'll take it for a test drive and I suggest you do the same before picking up one of these turds.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Fizz and noise issues", "unixReviewTime": 1328400000, "reviewTime": "02 5, 2012"}

It was brand new, unopened, in box.  They allowed me to examine it prior to purchase. In that environment I thought it a nice instrument.However, it can be difficult to properly examine an instrument in a busy store, and that store was VERY busy and noisy.  It's when you get it home and can examine it leisurely in peace and quiet that the details stand out.This is indeed a 6-string ukulele.  It measures a bit over 28\" top to bottom and has the sound of a baritone uke.  I have heard throatier and more mellow instruments in the same price range.  The advantage to this of course is it's 6 string, so if you're a guitar player you can achieve the ukulele sound and portability without learning totally new fingering.... that is of course, until you realize that while it has 6 strings, it is not tuned like a guitar.  It's tuned to ADGCEA rather than EADGBE.  One cannot simply play guitar music on this instrument; all such music has to be transposed or new chord name recognition learned.  Being a total newbie to ukes, this was news to me until I got it home and read the instructions.  So my primary purpose in purchasing this-- to have a small portable guitar, hit a snag.Now that's not totally the end of the thing, because you can be a little inventive and use alternate string sizes to tune this to standard guitar tuning.  It takes a bit of experimentation but it is possible to set this up to standard guitar tuning if one doesn't mind buying a couple of string sets and playing mixup.  So all is not lost there.  It was just an unexpected surprise-- mainly because I didn't research the instrument prior to purchase (it's rare that I impulse buy).So tuning aside we get to the quality of instrument.  That's where the Yamaha really falls short.  This is an oil rather than a lacquer or shellac finish and in several places the oil was still visible and could be wiped away by hand.  There were a couple of glitches in the finish straight out of the box.  That this was a \"rush job\" out of a factory with no finish work at all was blatantly obvious.There are no strap pegs; those will require being added by hand (not difficult, but extra expense and time).The action is of course too high.  That's not unusual-- in truth it's quite common in off-the-shelf stringed instruments and came as no surprise.  But along with the other failures in workmanship it stood out here.However, the thing that bothers me the most:  if I wasn't aware this is a Yamaha Guitalele... I'd think it's was a cheap knock-off child's guitar.  There's not one thing about this instrument that says \"quality\"-- which is quite disappointing.  This instrument sells for about $100.  That low cost is obvious.  This is a \"cheap guitar\" in every way.  I can't honestly say it's a toy, but it reeks \"beginner instrument\".  The tuners are as cheap as they come,  the finish is cheap, there is no decoration, no protective edging. The finish is-- unfinished.I bought this solely based on the number of positive reviews here on Amazon-- and I respect those reviews.  People have different tastes and for some folks this has a \"home made\" feel that they will love.  However I've been playing guitar for (mumblety mumble) deca...uh... years and I know the difference between quaint and cheap.  I own two Ovation guitars, a Peavey electric bass, a hand-made violin and an Epiphone electric uke (which is of such higher quality it's not even a contest. And no I'm not hawking Epiphone.  Facts is facts, that's all.  You can read my very-positive review on the Epiphone on Amazon).When I got this  home and took a good look at it, I found no sign of quality or craftsmanship, nothing that said anything more than \"this was made as cheaply and quickly as humanly possible\".  In truth the only positive thing I have to say about it is that it does have a spruce top and the strings are of reasonably decent quality.Other than those two factors, one can find $40-$50 full-size guitars all over Amazon that equal or surpass this instrument in quality.  The only benefit this would offer is its smaller size and ukulele voice-- if someone particularly wants an inexpensive portable guitar tuned like a uke.  Other than its portability, I find no special merit in this and even at its relatively low price... consider it over-priced (or rather, under-made).One must grant it's largely a matter of personal taste and expectation.  But low quality is low quality.(Edit two weeks later:  I just today saw the Cordoba at a local store-- a direct competition to this instrument.  The Cordoba is MUCH nicer.  It's built better, has better sound, and is finished out much more nicely.  Sorry Yamaha, but facts is facts.  Had I seen the Cordoba and Yamaha side by side, I'd have bought and kept the Cordoba.)That's my honest review.  I know some will disagree.  But others know exactly what I mean.  This isn't an expensive instrument so one really can't expect super-fine quality at this price. However-- I paid about the same price for my electric uke and it is superb quality from top to bottom.  As mentioned, the Cordoba is a better instrument and costs the same.Fortunately the local merchant has a satisfaction guarantee and I was able to return it.  I simply cannot recommend this instrument unless there are no better options-- and frankly, there are.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Considerable disappointment", "unixReviewTime": 1381536000, "reviewTime": "10 12, 2013"}

After two weeks of the returned item was delivered, I didn't hear anything from the seller regarding the return, so I emailed to the seller to see if we can settle it asap.  Too bad, four days after the email had been sent, I only got the email of telling me the case# of the message I sent without any further response to my refund.  until my patience is gone to deal with this hassle, and I don't think it's worth to waste more time on it, despite the fact of wasting the time and money I spent on this useless pickup and the shipping costs. Therefore, yesterday, I emailed my last contact to the seller regarding the refund of the purchase and gonna report this to AMAZON about the bad after-sale service I ever have before if I still haven't heard from the seller shorty.Today, I finally received the seller's response to my refund, the seller denies the issues of the pickup and claims, \"it was not defective. All pickups are going to get unwanted noise if you move the guitar. The feedback can be to to many other issues. I have issued the refund of $7.04.\"  Obviously, the reply is unconvincing; although the feedback can be raised from varies issues, i have tried with another pickup to the same directions and setups, but it doesn't have such problems at all.  The fact is NOT ALL pickups get UNWANTED noise although I didn't try many pickups.  Cherub Guitar Pickup doesn't work as the product description to pickup the original tones of the instrument regardless the surrounding noises.  Moreover, the unwanted loud noise from its wire movements is really annoying, and there's no way to stop the wire movements while strumming. Indeed, I won't use it, and I don't want it to sit at my house as a useless property, so returning back to the seller may help to improve the issues it has.  However, the hassles I got from the seller is totally unexpected and it's NOT worth at all.By the way, I'm also unhappy about the refund of &7.04, I bought it for $8.79 along with AMAZON Free Shipping of the purchase of $25 or more.  To me, it is not the money of $1.75, but it's not fair to the buyer, who doesn't get the right service and quality from the purchase but only wastes the times and money on this matter. So if you really need a pickup for your instrument, I highly recommend you to spend few more dollars to get a much better and reliable one. Don't make the same mistake as I did to try this one because of the cheap price, in turn, you may get more hassles than you expect on such cheap merchandise.  I don't want that happens to anyone else, so I decided to tell you what I went through to keep you from the possible hassles before betting on it.2 STARS FOR THE 1ST REVIEW AFTER USING IT TWICE:I like the clip-on design, which is easy to use, so it is worth 2 stars; however, it doesn't work well clipping on small soundholed string instruments like ukes and kid size guitars because it touches the strings.  Besides that, it also picks up loudly through the wire's own movements, not as the description \"regardless the surrounding noises.\"  I have distressed from those unwanted loud noises.  One more thing that it somehow produces much higher feedback to the mini amp that I use, and I have to turn the volume as low as possible to prevent the high frequency of feedback. However, when I switch to another pickup with the same setup on mini amp and acoustic guitars or uke. the amp doesn't have any feedback even turning it to almost the highest volume, and the other pickup doesn't have the unwanted noise from its own movement either.  I don't know whether is my lack of luck or the poor pickup I got ... I bought it because its cheap price (less than $9) & clip-on design, but, I can't accept the noises and I have to waste my shipping cost to return it back to the seller. So, if you want to give it a try, you may bear in mind that the seller, BrookMays, doesn't take any responsibility for the shipments even the item doesn't work properly as claimed description.

It's less than ten bucks.It has a specially-designed clamp that is good for attaching it to the sound hole of a guitar.  As such it is not going to work for an instrument without a considerable-size sound hole.  It also will tend to get in the way of those who play directly over the sound hole, as it is quite easy to hit and will pick up any contact noise.It is more sensitive than cheaper competitor devices.  Unless you run it directly into the amp within a distance of 8 ft you are also going to need a 1/4\" to 1/4\" coupler (to allow it to connect to an extension guitar cord).  You will need such extension as this tends to have significant feedback issues if the amp is too close or facing the guitar.It is a passive pickup, so you will need either an amp with a passive-specific input or a preamp mixer or other preamp device. If you don't have a preamp system, this will do you no good.So because of the limitations I rate it as above.  For what it does though-- providing a passive pickup that can be quickly switched out between instruments, it does okay.  I believe there are better pickup concepts out there for about the same amount of money, including adhesive-disk mikes.  I would prefer to permanently mount a pickup of some kind and there are many low-cost pickups out there to choose from.

The Snark goose neck is easily broken, and hard to keep safe in a gig bag. This works much better in that regard. This one is fairly bright and easy to see in all lighting conditions. It mounts very positively and seems to sense all strings fine.  Tuning accuracy? Hard to say- it just indicates high / low / on pitch, really. I prefer the more precise and wider scale +/1 readout of the Snark. They are much more precise- nearly good enough to intonate an instrument. But this is probably good enough for most, just to get dialed in at the rehearsal or gig.The negatives, and why I can't recommend it are as follows. The battery cover on mine fits very loosely. I worry the battery will fall out very easily. I may end up gluing it in place. It isn't immediately obvious where the battery goes or how to open it, and there's no indicator which way the battery goes in (+ is up I think).  The second fault is that once it is on your headstock the string note letters display perpendicular to the user- that's right, sideways.  On a bass, I don't really need it to tell me which string I'm plucking or tuning, but I still find myself craning my neck sideways to read it.

Pretty much run your monitors into the line outputs, connect a mic or (apparently) a \"low-headroom\" instrument to it, run the USB cable to your computer and set it up within the DAW described parameters. It would have been nice to know that the included Plug In Suite is not a stand-alone program, and that it functions in tandem with Ableton Live Lite and that it could be found it in the Plug-Ins section of Ableton, but I figured it out EVENTUALLY regardless. (Ableton itself is rather dodgy, and seems to crash constantly.) Sometimes the 2i2 seems to lock up completely, so as no audio is being produced from my monitors!I wasn't sure for a very long time if this was USER ERROR, an Ableton problem, or the fault of the 2i2 and its drivers, so after the gazillionth crash, I screamed \"Ballsdogit!!!\", and purchased a license for Reaper. After going through the painstaking setup and acclimating to the new DAW over the last few months, I began to realize that my monitors no longer \"lock up\", but that the drivers for the 2i2 are indescribably pathetic!!!I had to tweak the living daylights out of Reaper just to get an audible sound out of my monitors. Now I'm in there and the FX do not work with the focusrite drivers. Garbage focusrite! Everyone I know that has Reaper raves about the plug-ins, and the greatness and ease of the setup regardless of the interface. I have yet to experience a crash, but I also have yet to experience any recording time.Seriously, I started reading on the Reaper Forums about problems encountered with the 2i2, and came across a response from David@focusrite actually saying that \"you should not use this setup to record electric guitar..\", and that if you need to record electric guitar you should \"get something with more headroom like the 2i4.\" That is just unbelievable in my eyes!I'm sure I could run this through my mixer and get the lacking headroom and just use this paperweight as a bridge gap between my mixer and laptop, but why should I have to after dropping a buck fifty on this miracle? Besides that, I'll more than likely still have multiple problems with the drivers!This device is clearly marked for both XLR inputs and 1/4 instrument ins. There was no warning of headroom limitations anywhere in the documentation, and I researched audio interfaces for several weeks before deciding on this unit. I feel lied to and disrespected as a customer, now stuck with an irrelevant piece of outdated technology. HOW IN THE HECK DOES THIS THING HAVE A NEARLY 5 STAR RATING!!!????The good side is that the mic pres are nice and warm. I have a bunch of different mics and the 2i2 (when not crashing or locking up the monitors) seems to handle all of them well. I constantly check for driver updates, and have the latest drivers for the 2i2, but without a doubt the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 is probably going by the wayside along with my faith in focusrite and their products.Sorry focusrite, you dropped the ball here.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "No Headroom for Electric Guitar", "unixReviewTime": 1351468800, "reviewTime": "10 29, 2012"}

I don't use Distortion pedals.), next is an MXR Micro Chorus followed by an MXR Carbon Copy Analog Delay. The whole chain goes into the 2nd channel of my Fender Deluxe Reverb amp.

I simply love the sound on these cans, but the speakers are just too dang close to the surface (not deep enough in the cups) and press down hard on my ears. The max time I can wear them is like an hour, and then I can't wear them for a day or so due to residual pain. I guess if they used thicker pads to deepen the cups, that might help. Also, on most of my other phones, the speaker areas have fairly flat surfaces, while this one has the speakers jutting out of the cups and are covered by just one thin nylon sheet. So it's kind of like double trouble. However, these really do have great sound (especially the tight bass clarity). If it weren't for the discomfort factor, I would be using them all the time. As of now, I hardly use them at all. In fact, when I first tested these out, I was ready to hop on the computer and order a couple more. But I'm glad I waited to really give them a more prolonged test. Of course, we are all of varying shapes and sizes, ha ha, so they might work for you where they don't for me.

I was excited to try out this interface and see what it could do. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.While the construction and mechanical function of the device itself were good, the actual function with the computer left much to be desired. Also, the complete lack of a manual with the one I got made it very difficult understand the functions. (Sorry, but with a device this expensive and which includes 2 CDs of software, how hard would it be to include a full manual on the install CD?)There was a very small quick start guide included, which basically just named the various switches, inputs, and outputs, and gave extremely sparse directions about using the software mixer screen. I was forced into trial and error to see if I could get a serious recording in anything remotely resembling a multi-track mode. I could not. I could record and layer multiple tracks (I was using Audacity, didn't want to install Cubase), but I could not get playback from the previous tracks while I also had live input. Now this could have been my computer or Audacity, as it is an older Win XP machine, but it played back multiple tracks without problem.There was nothing in the mini-quickstart guide to address this, or even hint where one should look, other than going to Tascam's web site. I'm sorry, but that is just not good enough with a device this expensive. There should be a complete manual, at least in pdf, included with the product. If I am going to use this to do serious recording, the last thing I want to do is waste huge amounts of time digging information out of a website, or worse, from \"user community\" threads in some blog.Which brings me to another minor complaint - no Linux drivers included. I use mostly Linux, with only one Windows machine for software which I can't get on Linux. I wanted to try the software under Wine on Linux but was under time constraints.Then there are the generic problems with software interfaces replacing hardware. With a hardware mixer, I can access as many controls as my fingers can handle (3 or 4 on some mixers) at the same time. Computerized mixers can only do 1 thing at a time, and one must be constantly moving the cursor from one thing to another to access controls. The controls on  this interface were very fussy, and you have to position the cursor just exactly on a very small portion of a button to get it to react. I found it very tedious, and again, no actual instructions were included to help with that process. With a touch screen, it might be easier, but then why not just use buttons on a real mixer in that case? (Yeah, I know, touch screens are COOL.)Also, software based functions are always limited by your computer and OS, and that means everyone can have a different experience - consistency is much harder to maintain.I am old school, and find hardware mixers far more responsive and useful. I know that lots of people are all excited about having software versions of hardware in their computers, and saving space, etc., etc. I value function over fashion, however, and that is what I have always liked about Tascam gear: it was supremely functional. This software falls far short of what I expect from Tascam, and the lack of a manual for the interface is inexcusable.Good mixers, especially for multi-track recording, can be complex and difficult to learn. The layers of signal interconnection can be hard to understand at first, and takes some time to get comfortable with. Old Tascam manuals actually used to have a certain amount of instruction in multi-track recording, which was helpful to aspiring recording artists. Not so here.I had really hoped to give this 3 or 4 stars, but sadly, it only rates a 2 (2.5 if I could) for me.

I had hoped that it would at least last one hour on with a battery so that I wouldn't need to carry a power adapter along.The factory battery lasted about 1 hour. The second brand new fresh Duracell battery lasted about 20 minutes. I started recording a loop with another (3rd) fresh battery (tested 9.10 v with a multimeter) and the unit started behaving erratically after a few seconds of recording, suggesting that it was faulty. The lights started coming on and off randomly (record/undo/all three together, then off, then undo on, then all three on etc. etc.)The first time I used the JamMan XT (with the factory battery) it seemed to be working OK and all I can say is that as a basic looper it sucked.I am used to synching loops with other loopers and timing is everything, so I know it was not my poor technique. The main problem was that it didn't matter how hard I tried (even if I did a manual fade out) there was always a gap of about 2 seconds between the end of the loop and the start. This makes the unit useless.Also, it is poorly conceived in that, to replace the battery you have to take out 2 screws... exposing the delicate printed circuit board.The potential for damage here is very high. Also, replacing the screws needs to be done very carefully to avoid cross threading the screws and messing up the receiver nuts which are mounted directly onto the circuit board. To save a few dollars Digitech did not have the foresight to manufacture the unit with a battery box which would have protected the electronics and possible (read INEVITABLE) damage.I have owned quite a few Digitech products over the years and generally they are well thought out and well constructed but they have really dropped the ball on this one.It's going back to the store where I purchased it.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Very dissapointed in Digitech", "unixReviewTime": 1389052800, "reviewTime": "01 7, 2014"}

But what was Ned smoking when he decided to have the trigger handle and main support stem, including the pick clip and tuner holder, protude outward away from the fingerboard? It's awkward to apply and remove quickly. It's visually distracting for player and audience, and it doesn't add any mechanical benefit to the already excellent tension adjustment.The only possible justification I can come up with is having less to obstruct the fretting hand behind the neck -  but even that doesn't fly. Regardless of capo tension you should position it as close to the fret as practical and, unless you're avoiding playing that first fret (or use a low-thumb classical fret hand position) you're always going to feel some part of the capo against the leading edge of your hand. I own the older Planet Waves tri-action capo and never felt that to be a problem.Otherwise the construction of the NS Artist Capo is superb. The surface is arched, probably between a 10-12 radius that works fine on various Strat fingerboards as well as a flatter SG/LP style. It doesn't work as well on the very flat 16 radius of my Martin OM-1 which is virtually the same as a classical. If I cranked the tension it's possible the rubber would flatten out but I wouldn't risk marring the neck wood.I tried both the pick and tuner clips and they're functional, but to be honest I wouldn't use either - too distracting and I only use tuners to get an initial A, then tune each guitar to itself or to other instruments, depending on what they are.The only other capo I've ever used that protudes outward is the Kyser with its notorious 'wrought iron fence' design. I have one and, as good as the holding action is, I've never felt comfortable with the design. The older Planet Waves capo is still available so it comes down to preference.To top off the confusion, the picture on the front of the cardboard card the NS Artist comes mounted on shows a similar capo positioned in a way that's impossible with this capo!", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Bizarre Variant of the older Planet Waves Tri-Action Capo", "unixReviewTime": 1398297600, "reviewTime": "04 24, 2014"}
